# ============================ High TODO =============================
# Able to input next week lane to Jarvis somehow
# ** Every bowling night should remind Lane, brace, belt as well as usual conditioning and GPS
# Add some sort of interface for managing automations
# ** "X minutes before events called Y run Z command"
# ** Parse this schedule on every calendar change, but only schedule for the next 6? hours?
# Jarvis should interpret word numbers "two"
# Car should show if camp/wait/etc mode is on
# ActionEvent Index should show total/page counts (especially when filtering)
# Passive notifications into Reminders cell- notification shows up, isn't noisy or obtrusive.
# Log events with types - for example, WS should get logged and be visible on a page
# Remind should always be future
# "take" should not have such high priority
# # "at noon/midnight" should work
# Printer functions should not require dots to call
# Only send start/directions to car if itâ€™s off
# "Refresh" in Home (cell) should open the link for Nest
# Able to add other deliveries to Home(cell) with expected dates
# Jarvis app - downloadable, tracks location, manages reminders, lists, automations, etc
# Jarvis RNG
# Fix Notes and other livekey cells to use new scrolling techniques used with Js.Js
# Scrape a site. Provide a URL and some selectors and then set an interval and have it alert you when your requested check happens.
# Some reminders in [Reminders] should only show up when it's time, not 6-7 hours before...
# Jarvis specific dates don't get picked up "Remind me Oct 23 at 9:32am to wish B Happy Birthday"
# If car is off, location should be nearest store - if car is on, show street/city
# Donâ€™t show Log in Jarvis logs
# Navigate should also start the car (if not already on)


# =============================== Bugs ===============================
# Always navving home with directions
# "Take" is acting as a keyword for traveling, but should not take priority over "remind"
# -- Should only be "take ME"
#   [5:01 PM] Navigating to remind steak out
#   [1:14 PM] I'll remind you to take steak out on Mon Aug 8 at 5:00 PM


# =============================== TODO ===============================
# Allow asking questions: What's my car temp? What's the house temp? etc...
# * Pick random number, weather update...
# create a timer that sends a WS to Dashboard and starts a timer (or sms? How to determine which is which?)
# Ability to undo messages or logs
# If question that doesn't match others, google and read the first result?
# Able to schedule an event for "every day" -> For example, sending good morning text
# Eventually? Able to say, "Remind me when I get home to..."
# * This triggers a job that reschedules itself for distance from house - 5 minutes
# * When <5 minutes from house, trigger given action
# Eventually? "Let me know before any night that's going to be a hard freeze"
# Monitor phone location with FindMy API
# Add budget stuff back in
# > I donâ€™t remember what I had for breakfast
# > When was the last time I had <food>
# > When was the last time I ate
# > I donâ€™t know the last time I ate
# > What was the last thing I ate?
# Able to see schedules somehow
# Remind me every 5 minutes to jump until I say stop ðŸ˜±
# Jarvis, Venmo X $Y
# Somehow automate running th`e soecs to notify when there is a failing one Githook -> server -> test env on server?
# Jarvis conversations- can ask questions and allow responding back
# Auto message when garage is still open after a certain time
# Add contacts to Jarvis for navigating

# =============================== Desired examples ===============================
# get the car|house|home, how's the car, tell me about the car, give me the car
# Did I leave the car/house unlocked?
# is the car unlocked?
# is the AC on?
# What did I have for breakfast?
# > You had cereal this morning, sir.
# Good morning / greeting
# > Good morning, sir. The weather today is <>. You don't have anything scheduled after your morning meetings.
# Good afternoon
# > Good afternoon, sir. The weather for the rest of the day is <>. You don't have any more meetings scheduled.
# Good night
# > Good night, sir. The weather tomorrow is <>. You don't have anything scheduled after your morning meetings.
# > You'll need to leave for PT by 9:55
# Start my car before I need to leave for PT


# =============================== Jarvis.js ===============================
# Able to remove items from history using live-key, which enumerates the list items.
# -## will remove that item from display
# Able to ignore some messages?
# Able to set rules to only show certain messages for a certain amount of time?
