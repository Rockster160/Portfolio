# [!] fixme now
# [>] hack, fix soon
# [^] Known Bug
# [ ] default importance
# [*] icebox, fix sometime™️
# [?] Needs checking - Might be fixed
# [/] Blocked Internally - Needs other features
# [X] Blocked Externally - Cannot be built


# =============================== Bugs ===============================
# [^] Always navving home with directions
# [^] Remind should always be future
# [^] Log should always be past
# [^] Jarvis specific dates don't get picked up "Remind me Oct 23 at 9:32am to wish B Happy Birthday"
# [^] Jarvis should interpret word numbers "two"


# ============================== TODO ================================
# [ ] "at noon/midnight" should work
# [ ] Only send calendar start/directions to car if it’s off
# [ ] "Refresh" in Home (cell) should open the link for Nest
# [ ] Able to add other deliveries to Home(cell) with expected dates
# [ ] Fix Notes and other livekey cells to use new scrolling techniques used with Js.Js
# [ ] Navigate should also start the car (if not already on)
# [ ] If a remind is within a few hours, say “I’ll remind you in 3 hours at 16 minutes to…”
# [ ] Jarvis conversations- can ask questions and allow responding back
# [ ] Add contacts to Jarvis for navigating
# [*] Printer functions should not require dots to call
# [*] Car should show if camp/wait/etc mode is on
# [*] Passive notifications into Reminders cell- notification shows up, isn't noisy or obtrusive.
# [*] Log events with types - for example, WS should get logged and be visible on a page
# [*] Jarvis app - downloadable, tracks location, manages reminders, lists, automations, etc
# [*] Jarvis RNG
# [*] If car is off, location should be nearest store - if car is on, show street/city
# [*] Don’t show Log in Jarvis logs
# [*] Allow asking questions: What's my car temp? What's the house temp? etc...
#     * Pick random number, weather update...
# [*] Eventually? Able to say, "Remind me when I get home to..." - Could use some new JT trigger that pings phone location
#     * This triggers a job that reschedules itself for distance from house - 5 minutes
#     * When <5 minutes from house, trigger given action
# [*] Monitor phone location with FindMy API
# [*] Add budget stuff back in
# [*] > I don’t remember what I had for breakfast
# [*] > When was the last time I had <food>
# [*] > When was the last time I ate
# [*] > I don’t know the last time I ate
# [*] > What was the last thing I ate?
# [*] Jarvis, Venmo X $Y
# [*] Somehow automate running specs to notify when there is a failing one Githook -> server -> test env on server?


# =============================== JarvisTasks ===============================
# [/] Able to see schedules somehow
# [/] JarvisCache should have an interface to view/edit/add/remove anything from the cache
# [ ] Able to input next week lane to Jarvis somehow
#     * Use a JarvisCache to store the next week and on schedule, send message
#     * Every bowling night should remind Lane, brace, belt as well as usual conditioning and GPS
# [ ] Add some sort of interface for managing automations
#     * "X minutes before events called Y run Z command"
#     * Parse this schedule on every calendar change, but only schedule for the next 6? hours?
# [*] Scrape a site. Provide a URL and some selectors and then set an interval and have it alert you when your requested check happens.
# [*] Sending good morning/day summary text
# [*] Check for hard freeze next day / next week
# [*] Auto message when garage is still open after a certain time of day


# =============================== Desired examples ===============================
# [/] get the car|house|home, how's the car, tell me about the car, give me the car
#     * Done after JV integrations are completed
# [/] Did I leave the car/house unlocked?
# [/] is the car unlocked?
# [/] is the AC on?
# [/] What did I have for breakfast?
#    > You had cereal this morning, sir.
# [*] Good morning / greeting
#    > Good morning, sir. The weather today is <>. You don't have anything scheduled after your morning meetings.
# [*] Good afternoon
#    > Good afternoon, sir. The weather for the rest of the day is <>. You don't have any more meetings scheduled.
